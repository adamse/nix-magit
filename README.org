* Running Magit inside Nix-Shell
This is a [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] expression that runs Emacs with the famous Magit packages.
It is inspired by [[https://github.com/vlandeiro/magit-docker][magit-docker]] (or [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/d0qnbf/dockerized_magit/][Dockerized Magit]]) but uses Nix instead of Docker.
** Prerequisites
Since this program requires Nix, your operating system must support Nix.
At present, Linux and Mac are supported, but Windows is not.
However, you can install Nix on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
** Installation
Install Nix package manager, if you haven't already:

#+begin_src shell
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
#+end_src

For details, see [[https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation][the Nix manual]].
** Usage
Inside a Git repository, run the following command:

#+begin_src shell
nix-shell https://github.com/akirak/nix-magit/archive/master.tar.gz
#+end_src

Then Emacs starts and Magit displays the status of your Git repository.
